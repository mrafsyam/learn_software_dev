# Learn to become a Software Developer

This is a curated list of planning, courses and things that I've put together in order to help my friends who has zero or minimal IT background to become an entry-level Software Developer, Software Tester (QA) or Technical Support.

If you're an undergraduate, this would be useful for you too.

## The motivation 
This is inspired by my brother, who didn't have a collegue degree or even SPM qualification. 
When we get started in 2016, he didn't have any knowledge in programming. We started from the basic of HTML/CSS and built simple static websites.
Now in 2021, he is working as a Frontend Software developer - full time, with 4 years experience, at the age of 21. 

I believe anyone **who has the time** can become a Software Developer. Software Developer is a good-paying job which is always going to be in demand in **Malaysia** in the foreseeable future.

### Requirement 
* **Require at least 3-4 hours a day of your time** (More is better). Software Developement can be overwhelming. The key is to keep on learning even when you're struggling. Once you have started to pick up and do more examples and projects, the struggle shakes off and you'll find it easier going forward.
* **Degree or Diploma in IT is not required**. There are companies who only look for people who can do the job, regardless of the qualification on paper. After about 6 months of proper training, you will be better equipped than most Malaysian IT graduates. 
* **Age does not matter**, as long as you can use the computer. 
* **Wilingness to learn and ask questions**. You are going to get stuck (I still do). Don't be shy to ask.
* **Learn to Google and use Stack Overflow** when you have problems. 99% of problems you encounter when you start out can be found online.

### Deliverables (if you stick to the plan)
* A list of presentable projects worked by you.
* Some experience in Software Testing (QA)
* An online portfolio (websites) showcasing your projects. Example : [Kemaman.org](http://www.kemaman.org), [theonlyinfo.com](http://www.theonlyinfo.com), [mattfarley.ca](http://mattfarley.ca)
* A **polished** resume for you to apply for work.
* An internship, a part time or full time job.

## First steps
* Have an email. Gmail is the best.
* Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account 
* Register at [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/)

# The Learning Plan 
* The learning plan isn't focused on doing the most amount of work. Instead, I tried to get you to **focus on the things that matter most in order to get employed.**
* The plan is to get you equipped with the basic. The real growth happens when you start working on real projects with real teams. 
* The main course (#1) is for you to **start first** (with some priority). 
* The secondary courses (#2 & #3) is for you to do along with the main course, **whenever you can.**
* For example, you can start the secondary courses when you want to take a break from the main course temporarily.
* All courses are to be completed.

Target : **3-4 hours daily**.
